        <p> My name is Na'im Williams. I am born and raised on the southside of Atlanta, Collegepark district to be exact. I recently graduated from Jackson State University with a Bachelor's in Information Technology. I have 3 siblings and i am the eldest out of the bunch. I enjoy great scenery and various types of movies. Sneakers have also been a love of mine, ever since I was in diapers. </p>
